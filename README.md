    <h1>Foodie Dash</h1>
    <h3>A game where you collect food items with a leaderboard system</h3>
    <p>NOTE: this is a archive and now a "continued" version of the game</p>
    <p>The code here is really bad, and has really bad parts. If you want the true 1.0.0/non updating version, [go here](https://github.com/Lncvrt/Foodie-Archive/releases/tag/true-1.0.0)</p>
